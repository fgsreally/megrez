# megrez
I have high hopes for the megrez platform, and I hope it can truly help all developers.

The Megrez platform is responsible, and only responsible, for handling assets. These assets can be an article, a component, an api, or anything you can think of. Megrez is responsible for managing them and presenting them in the form you desire.

It's simple enough and also provides enough freedom, which aligns perfectly with my personal design philosophy!


## start
Alright, you may be wondering how these assets are handled or what exactly Megrez does. Before answering that, I must add that assets can take on various forms, and even if they belong to the same category, they might appear differently in the hands of different users. Relying solely on objective classification might be too rigid, so let's try using developers to classify them!
